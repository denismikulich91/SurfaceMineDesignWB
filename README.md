# FreeCAD Workbench for Parametric Surface Mine Design 🚧⛏️

## Features 🌟

- **Parametric Toes and Crests Generation (Work In Progress)**  
  - Create toes and crests based on user-defined parameters and an optimization shell (under development).  

- **Freehanded Pit Bottom Sketching ✅ (Done)**  
  - Generate toes and crests from user-defined parameters and a freehanded pit bottom sketch (developed).  

- **Ramp Design 🚦(Not started)**  
  - Planned feature to enable the design of ramps (not started).  

- **Ramp Layout Optimization 📈 (Not started)**  
  - Layout ramps based on KPIs and Design of Experiments (DOE) principles (not started).  

- **Pit Optimization 🛠️ (Not started)**  
  - Use the ultimate pit limit open-source tool by [Matthew Deutsch](https://github.com/MineFlowCSM/MineFlow) to optimize pits (not started).  

- **OMF Integration 🌐 (Not started)**  
  - Full OMF integration for importing, exporting, and browsing data using [OMF Python](https://github.com/gmggroup/omf-python) (not started).  

- **Block Modeling Tool 🧊 (Not started)**  
  - Regular block modeling browsing and visualization tool (Not sure about this yet! 🤷‍♂️🤔).
