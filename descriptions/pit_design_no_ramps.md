# **Parametric Pit Design (Toes and Crests)**

## **Overview**

The Surface Mine Design Workbench is a powerful tool for designing open-pit mines using parametric principles. This module focuses on generating an open-pit design based on specified parameters and input optimization results (e.g., ultimate pit shells). The design is **fully parametric**, meaning any updates to parameters or input shells are instantly reflected in the model. The algorithm efficiently handles large and complex shells, recalculating in under a second.

The following video demonstrates the systemâ€™s capability, where three pits seamlessly join to form an "internal dump" in the middle. This dump projects upward and inward while the rest of the pit expands outward and upward:

The structure of the module is outlined below:

The key graphical features are **toes** and **crests**, while the **pit** and **bench** serve as container-like features. A **pit** consists of multiple **benches**, and each bench contains both a toe and a crest. To enhance usability, the parameters of toes and crests are aggregated at the bench level. For example, while the *minimum mining width* is a toe-specific parameter and the *face angle* applies to the crest, both are grouped together under the bench feature for easier parameter management.

This structure offers two key advantages:

- **Logical Organization**: Provides a clear hierarchy for design elements.
- **Parameter Propagation**: Parameters and visual settings can be propagated from parent features to child features. For example, setting a *minimum mining width* in the Pit feature will automatically propagate this value to all benches, while individual benches can override these settings as needed.

## **Toe Feature**

The **toe** is the most intricate feature in the workbench, forming the foundation for crest generation. Below is an overview of the **toe generation algorithm**:

1. **Intersection with Optimization Result**: Calculate the intersection of the optimization shell with the design.
2. **Midpoint Creation**: For each edge in the intersection, create a midpoint.
3. **Toe Vertex List (TVL)**:
   - Combine the midpoints into a closed polygon.
   - Append intersection vertices outside the polygon to the TVL.
4. **Shape Group Adjustments**: Add extra vertices to the TVL based on shape group parameters.
5. **Close Polygon**: Convert the TVL into a closed polygon to form the toe shape.

6. **Berm Width Adjustment**: For subsequent benches, unite the toe with the offset of the previous bench's crest to enforce the *minimum berm width* and maintain alignment with the optimization shell.
7. **Validation and Cleanup**: Remove redundant points and ensure geometry integrity.
8. **Visualization**: Instantiate the final toe geometry on the canvas.

## **Crest Feature**

The **crest** is simpler compared to the toe. It is generated as a vertical and horizontal offset of the bench toe, controlled by the following parameters:

- **Bench Height**: Sets the elevation difference between the toe and crest.
- **Face Angle**: Determines the slope of the crest.

The diagram below illustrates the crest generation process:

## **Bench Feature**

A **bench** acts as a container feature for a toe and crest, managing their parameters and visual settings. While it does not generate geometry itself, it is integral to organizing and controlling the design.

### **Key Attributes:**

- **Crest**: References the crest of the previous bench (if applicable).
- **Bench Toe and Bench Crest**: Links to the toe and crest features of the current bench.
- **Bench Height**: Controls the height difference between the current bench's crest and toe.
- **Berm Width**: Sets the horizontal offset of the crest from the toe.
- **Elevation**: Defines the elevation of the toe for the current bench.
- **Expansion Option**: Controls how the optimization shell impacts toe generation:
  - **Full Expansion**: Default option. Expands the bench entirely where the optimization shell width exceeds the berm width. (Node appears green in the data tree.)
  - **Partial Expansion**: Uses an external polygon to exclude certain areas from expansion. (Node appears green and purple.)
  - **No Expansion**: Ignores the optimization shell for toe generation. Useful for upper benches where the shell has minimal impact. (Node appears purple.)

![Expansion Options](pics/expansions.png)

- **Face Angle**: Controls the slope of the crest.
- **First Bench**: Boolean value indicating whether the bench requires input from a previous crest.
- **Minimum Area**: Filters out small polygons in the toe feature below a specified area.
- **Minimum Mining Width**: Ensures toe geometry maintains a minimum width.

### **Additional Parameters**

- **Significant Corner Length**
- **Significant Length**
- **Smoothing Ratio**

These parameters impact the toe geometry and are described in the toe generation algorithm.

## **Pit Feature**

The **pit** feature is a container for benches and manages their creation and arrangement. Key differences from the bench feature include:

- **No Elevation or Bench Height Parameters**: The pit feature defines a collection of benches, with individual elevations and heights specified via the **Bench Description** parameter.
- **Bench Description**: This parameter controls the number and arrangement of benches, using the following notation:
  - **Format**: `<StartElevation>,<EndElevation>,<BenchHeight>[;<StartElevation>,<EndElevation>,<BenchHeight>]`
  - Example: `"3620,3650,10"` creates 4 benches at elevations 3620, 3630, 3640, and 3650 with a height of 10 meters.
  - Example: `"3620,3650,10;3660,3670,5"` creates 4 benches at 10 meters followed by 2 benches at 5 meters.
